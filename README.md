# Genetic-Algorithms-Knapsack

This code was written for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Politechnika Wroclawska University, as a submission to the Genetic Algorithms exercise.

The main task was to implement a genetic algorithm to find a solution to the Knapsack problem with both weight and size constraints, while optimizing a value function. Also, visualization of the evolution of the solution space is included.
